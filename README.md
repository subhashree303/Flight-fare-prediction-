# Flight-fare-prediction-
• Conducted a flight fare prediction task using 9 different machine learning models: Linear regression, Decision tree, Random forest, Gradient boosting, Bagging, Extra trees, K Neighbours, Ridge and Lasso regression.
• Trained and compared the performance of each model on a publicly available flight fare dataset from Kaggle.
• Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ,Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R square and adjusted R square.
• Determined the best-performing model for the prediction task based on the evaluation results and used the selected model to make predictions on new, unseen test data to determine the fare price for a given flight.
